/**
 * main - Entry point
 * Write a program that prints all possible combinations
 * of two two-digit numbers.
 * - The numbers should range from 0 to 99
 * - The two numbers should be separated by a space
 * - All numbers should be printed with two digits.
 *   1 should be printed as 01
 * - The combination of numbers must be separated by
 *   comma, followed by a space
 * - The combinations of numbers should be printed
 *   in ascending order
 * - 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination
 *   of the numbers 0 and 1
 * - You can only use the putchar function (every
 *   other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
 * - You can only use putchar eight times maximum in your code
 * - You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
 * - All your code should be in the main functionn
 * Return: Always 0
